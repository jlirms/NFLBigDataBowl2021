Help evaluate defensive performance on passing plays

My submission is here: [redEPA: Quantifying good coverage, but no throw](https://www.kaggle.com/wonkydiamond/redepa-quantifying-good-coverage-but-no-throw), calculations were made in [this kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/wonkydiamond/nfl-redepa-per-play) which also contains the data provided. 

I will upload the custom utilities and scripts which created various models to this repo momentarily.
